# Classification

In this Assignment, "Pulsar star" dataset is used for implementing different Classification methods. 
For classification of the dataset, different methods like 
> Pocket algorithm, 
> Quadratic Discriminant Analysis(QDA), 
> Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), 
> Logistic Regression are implemented. 
Comparision of these methods are made based on the evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, recall, precision and specificity. 
Testing the learned model on the unseen data and seen data will help us understand how our model is performing on unseen data compairing with the seen data whether its underfitting or overfitting.
